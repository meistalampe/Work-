% Abstract

we want to find out if it is possible to design a fully automatic therapy system using vr and psycho physiological measurement.
therefor we will test our virtual environment with a random group of subjects
and measure ecg and gsr
the goal of the conducted experiment is to show that our virtual reality is capable ob causing fear
this will be done by evaluating the measured bio data 

furthermore our virtual can be controlled by a therapist 
the therapist will be able to exercise control through a matlab program 
provided with real time visual data the therapist will be a substitute for the AI which will later be controlling 
the vr respectively to the measured data

the vr and the related pc will feed visual input to the subject 
this input is processed by the subject and he gives output information in the form of gsr and heart rate
serving as input for our third system, the therapist (visual presentation of processed data)
therapist can control vr ---loop closed

%- a brief mentioning of the study and its attempt to treat acrophobia with a %virtual environment\\
%- theme of this thesis: the design of a VR fit to treat patients\\
%- goal: evaluate the worth of a VR therapy by measuring changes in the %subjects stress level(before/after)

%start
%Virtual reality is a high-end user-computer interface that involves real-time simulation and interactions through multiple sensorial channels\footnote{\citet*{burdea2003virtual}}. Virtual reality devices have been used for years in industry and healthcare, where researchers have been trying to develop and implement virtual reality in ways that could assist approaching and training various situations.\\
%With the advent of commercial virtual reality technology Head-Mounted-Displays (HMD) provide easier access to a vast field of possible applications. Including medical research using virtual realty to diagnose and treat diseases, allowing not only professionals but rather the patients to interact with a virtual environment.\\
%A striking example can be found in the field of psychotherapy.
%The treatment of psychological conditions such as acrophobia can be a challenging task considering traditional therapy involves exposing the patient to a hostile situation.\\
%As part of a study, which is set to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality guided exposure therapy in comparison to the established in-vivo therapy, the goal of this thesis is to provide a closed loop virtual reality fit to treat acrophobia.\\
%On that account we created a virtual environment which is appropriate for treating different degrees of acrophobia and designed a setup capable of adapting to the users needs. We demonstrate that a well tailored virtual reality can provide a safe and controlled environment without compromising on the quality of the therapy.\\


%Exposure therapy

%One treatment for patients with phobias is exposure therapy. In one instance, psychiatrists at the University of Louisville are using VR to help patients deal with fears of things like flying and claustrophobia.
%
%The VR experiences provide for a controlled environment in which patients can face their fears and even practice coping strategies, as well as breaking patterns of avoidance â€” all while in a setting that's private, safe, and easily stopped or repeated, depending on the circumstances.
