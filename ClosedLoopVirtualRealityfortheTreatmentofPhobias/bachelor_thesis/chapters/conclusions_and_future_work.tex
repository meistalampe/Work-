% Conclusions and Future Work

In conclusion, we are able to confidently state that our virtual environment and the presented height challenge are able to elicit psychophysiologigal fear reactions in the form of SCL and HR increases. Considering the effects, measured in non-phobic subjects we are confident to deploy our virtual reality system in the upcoming acrophobia study and trust in its applicability to exposure training. We understand that our system still needs refinement, especially in the field of data acquisition techniques, and eventually one stimulating situation may not be sufficient anymore, due to a habituation effects, but we have shown that the concept is functional and was well accepted.\\
Future studies should be focused on strict subject classification in bigger subject groups that include both non-phobic as well as phobic patients to verify these results.
