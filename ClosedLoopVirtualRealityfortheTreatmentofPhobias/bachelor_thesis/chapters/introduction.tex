- the use a virtual environment can have in treating acrophobia.
- point out the benefits of VRET over in vivo therapy (safety,one-fits all)

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Acrophobia} 
  definition of fear and specific phobias,prevalence, evolutionary 	 purpose(fight or flight),
  link fear to stress
  
\subsection{Stress}
definition of stress, ways of stress perception (eustress and distress)

\subsection{Electrodermal Activity,Galvanic Skin Response}
short explanation, influences(autonomic nervous system), role as method  to register physiological correlates of mental states like stress

- illustration of a typical gsr signal and explanation of its components (graph, peaks etc)  

- how and where is gsr usually measured? why there?

\subsection{Exposure Therapy}
what is exposure therapy? 
when is it used? 
how is it done? 
what is needed for it to be succesful?
